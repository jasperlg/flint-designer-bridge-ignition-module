# Changelog

All notable changes to the Flint Designer Bridge module will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Go-to-definition, cross-file references, and workspace symbol search returned
  URIs anchored at the editor's workspace root, which resolves only when the
  editor is opened on the project folder itself. When it is opened on an
  ancestor — a repo holding the project at
  `<workspaceRoot>/projects/<projectName>/` — the returned paths were missing
  that prefix, did not exist, and navigation silently failed.

### Added
- Clients may declare the project's on-disk folder via
  `initializationOptions.projectRoot` at `initialize` (or a `projectRoot` param
  on `lsp.definition` / `lsp.workspaceSymbol` over HTTP); it accepts a URI, an
  absolute path, or a path relative to `rootUri`. Requires a matching client
  change — clients that omit it keep the previous `rootUri`-based behavior.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Added a native Language Server Protocol endpoint over WebSocket at `/system/flint-lsp`, letting LSP clients connect directly to the gateway.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Released two signed artifacts per version: `Flint-Designer-Bridge-<version>-8.1.modl`
  for Ignition 8.1.44+ and `Flint-Designer-Bridge-<version>-8.3.modl` for
  Ignition 8.3.1+.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-09

### Changed
- Relicensed under the MIT License.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Added a headless gateway HTTP JSON-RPC endpoint at `/data/flint/rpc` (with `/data/flint/health`) so external tools can develop Ignition projects with no Designer running.
- Added gateway-scope script execution, tag/UDT operations, Perspective inspection, debug, full project resource + Perspective view CRUD, and Perspective component-registry + icon-library queries over the new endpoint, on both Ignition 8.1 and 8.3.
- Added gateway authentication for the new endpoint: native platform API tokens on 8.3 (`X-Ignition-API-Token`) and a Flint-managed bearer token on 8.1 (`Authorization: Bearer`), overridable via the `flint.gateway.apiToken` system property.
- Added a headless, editor-agnostic Jython (Python 2.7) language server in the gateway scope (`lsp.*` methods): syntax diagnostics, document and workspace symbols, hover, go-to-definition and references (intra-file and cross-file into project scripts), and completion sourcing `system.*` from the live gateway hint tree plus project-script modules — no external stubs and no Designer required.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-13
### Changed

- **Breaking:** Module ID renamed from `com.bwdesigngroup.flint-designer-bridge` to `dev.bwdesigngroup.flint.FlintDesignerBridge` to align with Ignition's reverse-DNS convention. Gateways with v0.13.x installed see this release as a separate module and must uninstall the old one before installing v1.0.0.
- **Breaking:** Java package path renamed from `com.bwdesigngroup.ignition.flint.*` to `dev.bwdesigngroup.flint.*` for consistency. The redundant `.ignition` segment was dropped (this is an Ignition module by definition).
